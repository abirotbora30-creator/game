Echoes in the Canopy â€” FPS Prototype (React + Three.js)
======================================================

This is a minimal first-person shooter prototype built with React + Three.js.
It's designed as a starter project you can deploy to Vercel or run locally.

How to run locally:
1. Unzip the project folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start dev server:
   npm run dev
4. Open the local URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

How to deploy:
- Push the folder to a new GitHub repository, then import the repo into Vercel and Deploy (automatic).
- Or build the static site (npm run build) and host on Netlify/GitHub Pages.

Notes:
- This is a prototype: art is primitive procedural geometry. Replace models, textures, and audio to improve immersion.
- Controls: Click the canvas to lock pointer and enable mouse look. WASD to move. Click to shoot. Space to jump.
